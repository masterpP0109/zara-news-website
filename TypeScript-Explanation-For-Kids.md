# TypeScript in Zara News Website - Explained Like You're 5!

Hey there, little coder! ðŸ‘‹ Let's learn about TypeScript in our Zara News website. I'll explain everything super simply, like telling a story to my little sister. We'll look at the code and understand what each part does. Ready? Let's go! ðŸš€

## What is TypeScript?

Imagine you're building with LEGO blocks. Regular JavaScript is like playing with blocks without instructions - you can build anything, but sometimes you make mistakes and the tower falls down.

TypeScript is like having a special LEGO set with instructions and labels on each block! It tells you exactly what blocks you need and how they fit together. That way, you make fewer mistakes and your tower (website) is super strong!

In our Zara News website, TypeScript helps us write better code for showing news articles.

## Let's Look at Our ArticleCard Component

Remember the ArticleCard? It's like a little card that shows a news article preview. Let's see how it's made with TypeScript!

### The Beginning - Imports
```typescript
import React from 'react';
import Image from 'next/image';
import Link from 'next/link';
import { User } from 'lucide-react';
import { Blog } from '@/types/blog';
import { getDisplayDate } from '@/lib/dateUtils';
import DateDisplay from '@/components/dateDisplay';
```

This is like saying "I need these tools to build my card":
- `React` - The main building blocks for websites
- `Image` and `Link` - Special tools from Next.js for pictures and links
- `User` - A little icon that looks like a person
- `Blog` - The instructions for what a blog article looks like
- `getDisplayDate` and `DateDisplay` - Tools to show dates nicely

### The Card's Instructions - Interface
```typescript
interface ArticleCardProps {
  blog: Blog;
  variant?: 'featured' | 'sidebar' | 'compact';
  className?: string;
  showImage?: boolean;
  showExcerpt?: boolean;
}
```

This is like a shopping list for our card! It says:
- `blog: Blog` - We MUST have a blog article (required!)
- `variant?` - We can choose how the card looks (optional)
- `className?` - Extra styling instructions (optional)
- `showImage?` - Should we show a picture? (optional)
- `showExcerpt?` - Should we show a little preview text? (optional)

The `?` means "you don't have to bring this, but you can if you want!"

### The Card Builder - Component Function
```typescript
export const ArticleCard: React.FC<ArticleCardProps> = ({
  blog,
  variant = 'featured',
  className = '',
  showImage = true,
  showExcerpt = false
}) => {
```

This is like "Here's how to build the card!" It takes all the ingredients from our shopping list and gives them default values if we didn't bring them.

### Making the Date Pretty
```typescript
const displayDate = getDisplayDate({
  publishedAt: blog.publishedAt || undefined,
  createdAt: blog.createdAt
});
```

This is like asking "When was this article written?" It checks if there's a published date, and if not, uses the created date.

### Different Card Styles - Variants

Our card can look different ways, like different costumes for a party!

#### Sidebar Style
```typescript
if (variant === 'sidebar') {
  return (
    <Link href={`/blogs/${blog._id}`}>
      <div className={`flex items-center justify-between cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors ${className}`}>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-start gap-2 my-2">
          <h5 className="text-[9px] sm:text-[10px] md:text-[11px] text-gray-500 uppercase">{blog.category}</h5>
          <h3 className="text-[13px] sm:text-[14px] md:text-[15px] font-medium">{blog.title}</h3>
          <DateDisplay date={displayDate} />
        </div>

        {showImage && (
          <div className="flex items-center rounded-full justify-center mb-4 w-[100px] h-[100px]">
            <Image
              src={blog.imageUrl || '/images/article_image1.jpg'}
              alt={blog.title || 'Article image'}
              width={100}
              height={100}
              className="object-cover rounded-full"
              priority
            />
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </Link>
  );
}
```

This sidebar card is like a skinny card that goes next to other things. It has:
- The category name (like "SPORTS" or "TECH")
- The article title
- When it was written
- A round picture on the right

#### Compact Style
```typescript
if (variant === 'compact') {
  return (
    <Link href={`/blogs/${blog._id}`}>
      <article className={`flex flex-col py-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors ${className}`}>
        {showImage && (
          <div className="relative h-36 sm:h-40 md:h-44 lg:h-48 xl:h-52 w-full mb-2">
            <Image
              src={blog.imageUrl || '/images/article_image1.jpg'}
              alt={blog.title || 'Article image'}
              fill
              className="object-cover "
              priority
            />
          </div>
        )}

        <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm text-gray-500">{blog.category}</p>
        <h5 className="text-sm sm:text-base font-medium text-gray-800 line-clamp-2">{blog.title}</h5>

        {showExcerpt && blog.excerpt && (
          <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm text-gray-600 mt-1 line-clamp-2">{blog.excerpt}</p>
        )}

        <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mt-2">
          <div className="flex items-center gap-1">
            <span className="w-4 h-4 sm:w-5 sm:h-5 rounded-full border border-gray-600 flex items-center justify-center">
              <User className="w-3 h-3 sm:w-4 sm:h-4 text-gray-600" />
            </span>
            <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm text-gray-500">{blog.author}</p>
          </div>
          <DateDisplay date={displayDate} />
        </div>
      </article>
    </Link>
  );
}
```

This compact card is smaller and fits in grids. It has:
- A rectangle picture at the top
- Category and title
- Maybe a little excerpt text
- Author name with a person icon
- The date

#### Featured Style (Default)
```typescript
return (
  <Link href={`/blogs/${blog._id}`}>
    <article className={`flex flex-col py-4 cursor-pointer hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow ${className}`}>
      {showImage && (
        <div className="relative h-30 sm:h-32 md:h-36 lg:h-40 xl:h-44 w-full sm:w-[200px] md:w-[220px] lg:w-[240px] xl:w-[260px] mb-3">
          <Image
            src={blog.imageUrl || '/images/article_image1.jpg'}
            alt={blog.title || 'Article image'}
            fill
            className="object-cover rounded-[1px]"
            priority
          />
        </div>
      )}

      <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-base text-gray-500">{blog.category}</p>
      <h5 className="text-[0.7rem] sm:text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base font-bold text-gray-600">{blog.title}</h5>

      {showExcerpt && blog.excerpt && (
        <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm text-gray-600 mt-1">{blog.excerpt}</p>
      )}

      <div className="flex items-center gap-3 mt-2">
        <div className="flex items-center gap-1">
          <span className="w-5 h-5 rounded-full border border-gray-600 flex items-center justify-center">
            <User className="w-4 h-4 text-gray-600" />
          </span>
          <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm text-gray-500">{blog.author}</p>
        </div>
        <DateDisplay date={displayDate} />
      </div>
    </article>
  </Link>
);
```

This is the big, fancy featured card for important articles!

## How Components Use ArticleCard

Let's see how other parts of our website use this card:

### Featured Section
```typescript
const Featured = () => {
  const { blogs: articles, loading, error, refetch } = useBlogs({
    endpoint: '/api/blogs/category/Featured',
    published: true,
    limit: 2
  });

  // ... loading and error handling ...

  return (
    <section className="flex flex-col divide-y w-full max-w-sm mx-auto lg:mx-0 space-x-4 divide-gray-300 border border-r-gray-500 mb-12 px-2 border-b-0 border-t-0 border-l-0 ">
      {articles.map((article) => (
        <ArticleCard
          key={article._id}
          blog={article}
          variant="featured"
        />
      ))}
    </section>
  );
};
```

This is like "Show me the special featured articles!" It gets 2 featured articles and shows them in a nice list.

### Editor's Picks
```typescript
const EditorsPicks = () => {
  const { blogs: articles, loading, error } = useBlogs({
    endpoint: '/api/blogs/category/Editors',
    published: true,
    limit: 8
  });

  // ... carousel logic ...

  const visibleArticles = articles.slice(currentIndex, currentIndex + articlesPerPage);

  return (
    <WideSectionHeader title="Editor's Picks" className="mb-4" />
    <div className="grid grid-cols-4 gap-4">
      {visibleArticles.map((article, index) => (
        <ArticleCard
          key={article._id}
          blog={article}
          variant="compact"
          className="h-full"
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

This shows articles picked by editors in a sliding carousel, 4 at a time!

## TypeScript Types We Use

### Blog Type
```typescript
interface Blog {
  _id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  excerpt?: string;
  author: string;
  category: string;
  tags?: string[];
  imageUrl?: string;
  published: boolean;
  publishedAt?: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  likes?: string[];
  comments?: Comment[];
}
```

This is like a blueprint for what every blog article must have and can have!

### User Type
```typescript
interface User {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'user' | 'admin' | 'superadmin';
  createdAt: string;
}
```

This tells us about website users.

## Why TypeScript Makes Our Code Better

1. **Catch Mistakes Early** - Like a spell checker for code!
2. **Better Help** - Your code editor can suggest what to type
3. **Team Work** - Everyone knows what the code should look like
4. **Safer Code** - Less chance of bugs that crash the website

## Fun Facts!

- TypeScript was created by Microsoft and is used by big companies like Google and Facebook
- It adds "types" to JavaScript, like labels on your toy boxes
- Our Zara News website uses TypeScript to make sure all the news articles display correctly
- The `?` symbol means "this is optional" - like choosing sprinkles on your ice cream
